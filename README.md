Tutorial "Indexing your lottery game data using The Graph's indexers" from the [LearnWeb3DAO](https://learnweb3.io) Junior course

Have a look at [https://lottery-game-graph.vercel.app/](https://lottery-game-graph.vercel.app/)

The [Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized query protocol and indexing service for the blockchain. It allows developers to easily track events being emitted from smart contracts on various networks, and write custom data transformation scripts, which are run in real time. The data is also made available through a simple GraphQL API which developers can then use to display things on their frontends.

Randomized numbers are generated using [Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/vrf) (Verifiable Random Function) and stored in the smart contract.
The graph is used in this lottery game to index the data of the lottery game. The data is then displayed on the frontend.
